    <h1>Credits</h1>
    <p>
        The HTML structure of this page, cascading style sheets and code is all
        written by the <a href="?page=about_us">authors</a>. Since they attend
        different courses at the same University College, they have diffrent profiencies in each
        programming language (Java, PHP etc.). The choice therefore was to allow everyone to use
        their skills to the best of their abilities by giving tasks based out of this. Though
        we cooperated like a team through the whole process helping each other out the best we could
        when one of us was stuck.

        In order to play, you have to log in. By logging in you agree to our

        The game follows regular BlackJack rules as stated in Wikipedia. You 
        click the Deal button to get cards, the game then deals two cards for 
        both you and the dealer. If you get BlackJack, that is a sum of 21, you
        instantly win!
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the dealers first cards is hidden from your view. You must decide 
        if you want to stand with the cards you allready got or draw more cards.
        Getting more cards is called 'hit', and you do this by clicking the Hit
        button. Otherwise you click the Stand button, to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a third option as well. It is called 'double down'. Clicking on
        the Double Down button, you increase your stakes by 100% and get one -1-
        extra card. You then automatically stand and the dealer draws.
    </p>
    <h2>Winning and loosing your bet</h2>
    <p>
        If your cards sum up to 21, you got BlackJack! This means you immediately
        win 3:2 of your bettings. Then you can play again, by clicking the Play
        Again button.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you get more than 21, this is a bust. You loose your bettings and can
        play again. Clicking the Play Again button always allows you to get new
        cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you stand with a sum less than 21, the dealers draw cards. The dealer
        draws until she wins, it's a tie or she busts. If the dealer busts, you 
        win 2:1 of your bettings. If it's a tie, you both have the same sum, you
        get your bettings back.
    </p>
    <h1>Changing settings and game rules</h1>
    <p>
        In the <a href="?page=settings">Settings page</a> you can change three 
        game settings. This alters the rules of the game. The first setting is
        the number of decks the dealer draws from. More decks means the same 
        card can be drawn twice or more, and makes counting cards harder. This
        setting is set to 1 deck by default.
    </p>
    <h2>Soft 17</h2>
    <p>
        By enabling 'Soft 17' the dealer automatically stands when she gets a 
        sum of 17 or higher. In the normal game rules she always draws until 
        she wins or busts, regardless of the sum she has. The soft part is that
        if she gets 17 AND has drawn an ace, she continues to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the dealer stands at 18, and you got 19, you win. This increases your
        chance of winning, albeit by a small margin. This rule is disabled by 
        default.
    </p>
    <h2>5 card win</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the small probability to draw as many as 5 cards without busting,
        some rules treat this as a win. By enabling this setting you win if you 
        click the Hit button until you are given 5 cards and still don't bust. 
        This setting is disabled by default.

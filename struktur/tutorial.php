        In order to play, you have to log in. By logging in you agree to our 
        <a href="?page=terms">terms of service.</a> They simply state that we
        set a cookie to track your high score, so that it is displayed next time
        you log in.

    <p>
        The game follows regular BlackJack rules as stated in Wikipedia. You 
        click the Deal button to get cards, the game then deals two cards for 
        both you and the dealer. If you get BlackJack, that is a sum of 21, you
        instantly win!
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the dealers first cards is hidden from your view. You must decide 
        if you want to stand with the cards you already got or draw more cards.
        Getting more cards is called 'hit', and you do this by clicking the Hit
        button. Otherwise you click the Stand button, to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a third option as well. It is called 'double down'. Clicking on
        the Double Down button, you increase your stakes by 100% and get one
        extra card. You then automatically stand and the dealer draws.
    </p>
    <h2>Winning and loosing your bet</h2>
    <p>
        If your cards sum up to 21 then you've just got a BlackJack! This means you immediately
        win 3:2 of your bets. Then you can play again, by clicking the Play
        Again button.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you get more than 21 then this is considered a bust. You loose your bets, the dealer wins
        and you are given the option to play again.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you stand with a sum less than 21, the dealer then draws cards. The dealer
        draws until it wins, it's a tie or she busts. If the dealer busts, you 
        win 2:1 of your bettings. If it's a tie, you both have the same sum of cards, then you
        get your bettings back.
    </p>
    <h1>Changing settings and game rules</h1>
    <p>
        In the <a href="?page=settings">Settings page</a> you can change three 
        game settings. This alters the rules of the game. The first setting is
        the number of decks the dealer draws from. More decks means the same 
        card can be drawn twice or more, and makes counting cards harder. This
        setting is set to 1 deck by default.
    </p>
    <h2>Soft 17</h2>
    <p>
        By enabling 'Soft 17' the dealer automatically stands when it gets a 
        sum of 17 or higher. By default it will always draw until 
        it wins or busts, regardless of the sum it has. The soft part is that
        if it gets 17 AND has drawn an ace, it continues to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the dealer stands at 18, and you got 19, you win. This increases your
        chance of winning, albeit by a small margin. This rule is disabled by 
        default.
    </p>
    <h2>5 card win</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the small probability to draw as many as 5 cards without busting,
        some rules treat this as a win. By enabling this setting you win if you 
        click the Hit button until you are given 5 cards and still don't bust. 
        This setting is disabled by default.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Achievements</h2> 
    <p>
        The game has two kinds of achievements, by getting on the high score list 
        and by playing a lot of games. Each achievement has three tiers you can 
        claim; bronze, silver and gold. Deleting you cookie or not logging in 
        for 100 days, removes all achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
        High scores: Bronze for claiming any place in the high scores. Silver 
        for placing in the top 5. Gold for claiming 1st place in high scores. 
        Playing the game: Bronze is awarded for playing 10 games. Silver is 
        awarded for 100 games. Gold is awarded for 1000 games.
